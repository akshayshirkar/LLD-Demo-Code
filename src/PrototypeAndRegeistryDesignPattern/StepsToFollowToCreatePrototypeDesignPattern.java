public class StepsToFollowToCreatePrototypeDesignPattern {
    // Step 1: Create the generice interface with clone method
    // Step 2: Class should have no argument constructor and copy constructor
    // Step 3: Create the object and call the clone method and pass the referance of the current object

   // PrototypeDesignPattern in inheritance

    //Step 1: Create the no argument constructor in child class
    //Step 2: Create Copy constructor
    //Step 3: override the clone method of the child

    //  WHEN TO USE THIS DESIGN PATTERN : this design pattern is used when we want the copy of the object. this solved the
    // problem like code reusablity
